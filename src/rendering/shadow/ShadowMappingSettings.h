/**
 * Basic settings for shadow mapping.
 * This class holds information about the dimension of the shadow map texture

 * the shadow is active. However, in order to smooth shadows that are far away,
 * the same information can be changed using setShadowDistance which will also
 * affect where shadows starts to fade out. This method should only be called
 * when depth changes considerably. To set the range in which shadows fade out
 * (from full-shadow to no-shadow) use setSmoothRange.
